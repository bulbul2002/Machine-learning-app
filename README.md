Machine learning web app

This is a web app which is created using #streamlit and #python. 
For an #arbitrary data, we can choose which algorithm to apply for #Binary #Classification of data. We can also change the #parameters. Also, this app calculates the #accuracy and #precision of that model along with plotting the #Confusion #Matrix, #ROC #Curve and #Precision #recall #Curve!
